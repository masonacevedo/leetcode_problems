# leetcode_problems
This is a set of leetcode problems I've finished. 

In addition to working code, each problem contains a 
docstring that describes what the problem is, and 
the idea for the solution. 

It's not quite pseudocode, but it's specific enough 
such that non-beginner programmers could implement 
the solution pretty easily.
